# Hello-world
This is my first repository.
 Quick Intro 
 My name is SHLOK SANYAL and I let inter call me Robo-Zen
 So in general I like to Innovate and create something and thus i chose to learn coding , because it is a path full of new things to learn  and is such a beautiful tool to Implement the great Ideas you come up with.
 Speaking of my other interests i like to THINK sometimes . I mean you can call me a philosopher because I always try to look at things through different Perspectives.
